ðŸ‘‹ Hey

My name is Jason FB, and I love the Web. Here are a few of the projects I'm working on:

Quick Video Chat is the first all-in-one browser based presentation platform for modern video chatting. It supports screensharing, multiple screenshares, has intuitive and immediate room entry that doesn't require sending the link(!), and a suite of operator controls to stage, unstage, move & mute participants and presenters. In a Quick Video Chat, everyone appears in a bubble a everyone's camera is on by default. Get started today at [QuickVideo.chat](https://quickvideo.chat/?utm_source=jfb-github-profile)



_Or find me these other places around the web_
