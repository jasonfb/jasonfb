👋 Hey

My name is Jason Fleetwood-Boldt, and I love the Web. 

Here are a few of the projects I'm working on:

Quick Video Chat is the first all-in-one browser based presentation platform for modern video chatting. It supports screensharing, multiple screenshares, has intuitive and immediate room entry that doesn't require sending the link(!), and a suite of operator controls to stage, unstage, move & mute participants and presenters. In a Quick Video Chat, everyone appears in a bubble a everyone's camera is on by default. Get started today at [QuickVideo.chat](https://quickvideo.chat/?utm_source=jfb-github-profile)



_Or find me these other places around the web_

[Hot Glue Rails Gem](https://github.com/hot-glue-for-rails/hot-glue)

The swiss-army knife of Ruby on Rails 8 scaffolding options, with the ability to slice up a CRUD/list layout, field-level access control, and perfect integration with the lightning fast Rails Turbo page loading parasigm (default in Rails 8).
